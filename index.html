                                <li><strong>Planning:</strong> This first stage involves completing a business analysis
                                    and
                                    creating a mobile
                                    strategy. A
                                    business analysis, marketer and project manager are usually involved.</li>
                                <li><strong>Technical:</strong> In this next stage, a technical writer is responsible
                                    for
                                    describing all

                                <li><strong>Prototyping:</strong> In the prototyping phase, the sketch, wireframes and
                                    app
                                    skins are created.
                                    This is
                                    usually
                                    completed by a UX/UI designer. </li>
                                <li><strong>Developing:</strong> This phase includes front-end and back-end coding
                                    segments
                                    and is performed
                                    by
                                    developers.
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Quality:</strong> During the quality assurance phase, tech requirements are
                                    tested and the device
                                    capability
                                    is
                                    reviewed to ensure that the app is working as it should.</li>
                                <li><strong>Publishing:</strong> Finally, the app is published to the app store.

                            </ol>
                            During the coding process, developers encounter two main types of paths:
                            Front End developers focus on how an app looks, while Back End developers focus on how an
                            app
                            works.<br>
                            </p>
                            <p class="example"><br>For example, if you were building an app, the front-end developer
                                would
                                be in
                                charge
                                of
                                creating the theme, style, presentation, and images. The back-end developer would work
                                on
                                the
                                database,
                                as well as the site’s security, users and overall site performance. Programming
                                languages
                                can
                                also
                                differ. For example, front end developers often use HTML, JavaScript, or CSS, while back
                                end
                                users
