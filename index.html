                    <p class="answer">App development is the process in which developers creare an application to be
                        used on
                        smartphones, tablets and other mobile devices. While app development sometimes involves creating
                        a
                        web-based app or a desktop version of the app, the majority of app development projects are
                        deployed
                        to
                        mobile and tablet</p>

                    <div class="what">App Development Lifecycle</div>
                    <p class="answer">The app development lifecycle features several steps involved in a typical app
                        development
                        project. These steps include:
                    <ol class="orderlist" type="1">
                        <li>Planning: This first stage involves completing a business analysis and creating a mobile
                            strategy. A
                            business analysis, marketer and project manager are usually involved.</li>
                        <li>Technical: In this next stage, a technical writer is responsible for describing all
                            technical
                            details
                            and requirements. </li>
                        <li>Prototyping: In the prototyping phase, the sketch, wireframes and app skins are created.
                            This is
                            usually
                            completed by a UX/UI designer. </li>
                        <li>Developing: This phase includes front-end and back-end coding segments and is performed by
                            developers.
                        </li>
                        <li>Quality: During the quality assurance phase, tech requirements are tested and the device
                            capability
                            is
                            reviewed to ensure that the app is working as it should.</li>
                        <li>Publishing: Finally, the app is published to the app store. Maintenance is provided on an
                            ongoing
                            basis
                            as updates, new releases and new bugs arise. </li>
                    </ol>
                    During the coding process, developers encounter two main types of paths:
                    Front End developers focus on how an app looks, while Back End developers focus on how an app
                    works.<br>
                    </p>
                    <p class="example">For example, if you were building an app, the front-end developer would be in
                        charge
                        of
                        creating the theme, style, presentation, and images. The back-end developer would work on the
                        database,
                        as well as the siteâ€™s security, users and overall site performance. Programming languages can
                        also
                        differ. For example, front end developers often use HTML, JavaScript, or CSS, while back end
                        users
                        may
                        use Ruby, PHP, Python, Java </p>

                    <p class="answer">No-code doesn't mean anti-code. There will always be a place for developers and
                        their expertise. But not knowing how to code shouldn't stop people from being able to launch
                        their ideas, build businesses, and follow their entrepreneurial aspirations. It's exciting to
                        see so many no code development platforms out there opening up the gateways for non-programmers
                        to create. </p>
